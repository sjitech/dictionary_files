he
He laughs best who laughs last.
He that loves the tree loves the branch
He that sups with the devil must have a long spoon.
He who gives fair words feeds you with an empty spoon
He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick.

it
it costs almost nothing
It falls to sb.'s lot.
it goes without saying
It is a long lane that has no turning.
It is a pity
It is a small world
It is across to you.
It is always a pleasure to greet a friend from afar
It is more blessed to give than to reveive
It is never too late to mend.
It is no use
It is no use crying over spilt milk
it is one's belief that
it is the same with
It never rains but it pours.
it occurs to someone that
it seems as if
it sounds so
It would try the patience of a saint.
it'll
it's
It's an ill bird that fouls its own nest.
It's dogged that does it.
It's dollars to buttons.
It's dollars to doughnuts.
it's engaged
It's never too late to mend.

you
You can's judge a book by it's cover
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
You cannot eat your cakes and have it.

You reap what you sow
